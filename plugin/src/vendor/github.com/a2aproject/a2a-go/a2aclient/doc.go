Package a2aclient provides a transport-agnostic A2A client implementation. Under the hood it handles
transport protocol negotiation and connection establishment.

A [Client] can be configured with [CallInterceptor] middleware and custom transports.
If a client is created in multiple places, a [Factory] can be used to share the common configuration options:

	factory := NewFactory(
		WithConfig(&a2aclient.Config{...}),
		WithInterceptors(loggingInterceptor),
		WithGRPCTransport(customGRPCOptions)
	)

A client can be created from an [a2a.AgentCard] or a list of known [a2a.AgentInterface] descriptions
using either package-level functions or [Factory] methods.

	client, err := factory.CreateFromEndpoints(ctx, []a2a.AgentInterface{{URL: url, Transport: a2a.TransportProtocolGRPC}})

	// or

	card, err :=  agentcard.DefaultResolver.Resolve(ctx, url)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to resolve an AgentCard: %v", err)
	}
	client, err := a2aclient.NewFromCard(ctx, card, WithInterceptors(&customInterceptor{}))

An [AuthInterceptor] provides a basic support for attaching credentials listed as security requirements in agent card to requests.
Credentials retrieval logic is application specific and is not handled by the package.

	// client setup
	store :=  a2aclient.InMemoryCredentialsStore()
	interceptors := WithInterceptors(&a2aclient.AuthInterceptor{Service: store})
	client, err := a2aclient.NewFromCard(ctx, card, interceptors)

	// session setup
	sessionID := newSessionID()
	store.Set(sessionID, a2a.SecuritySchemeName("..."), credential)
	sessionCtx := a2aclient.WithSessionID(ctx, sessionID)

	// credentials will be automatically attached to requests if listed as security requirements
	resp, err := client.SendMessage(sessionCtx, params)
